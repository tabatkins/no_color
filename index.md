# `NO_COLOR`
### Last updated: {{ 'now' | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

An increasing number of command-line software programs output text with
[ANSI color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors)
escape codes by default.
While some developers and users obviously prefer seeing these colors,
many users don't.
Unfortunately, every new piece of software seems to have a different way
of disabling colored text output and some software has no way at all.

Accepting the futility of trying to reverse this trend, an informal standard
is hereby proposed:

> **All command-line software which outputs text with ANSI color added should
check for the presence of a `NO_COLOR` environment variable that, when present
(regardless of  its value), prevents the addition of ANSI color.**

By adopting this standard, users that prefer to have plain, non-colored text
output can set one environment variable in their shell to have it automatically
affect all supported software.

This website will document which software has adopted this standard and when
support was added.
For software that has not or will not adopt this standard, an attempt will be
made to document how to otherwise disable color.

To add software to this site,
[clone this site's Git repository](https://github.com/jcs/no_color)
and submit a pull request.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Why not just set `$TERM` to `dumb` or `xterm` without color support?
Or change all color definitions in the terminal to print black?**

	The terminal is capable of color and should be able to print color when
	instructed.
	`NO_COLOR` is a hint to the software running in the terminal to suppress
	addition of color, not to the terminal to prevent any color from being
	shown.

	It is reasonable to configure certain software such as a text editor to use
	color or other ANSI attributes sparingly (such as the reverse attribute for
	a status bar) while still desiring that other software not add color unless
	configured to.
	It should be up to the user whether color is used, not the software author.

2. **How should configuration files and command-line arguments be processed
in the presence of `$NO_COLOR`?**

	User-level configuration files and per-instance command-line arguments
	should override `$NO_COLOR`.
	A user should be able to export `$NO_COLOR` in their shell configuration
	file as a default, but configure a specific program in its configuration
	file to specifically enable color.

	This also means that software that *can* add color but doesn't by default
	does not need to care about `$NO_COLOR`, because it will only ever be
	adding color when instructed to do so (as it should be).
